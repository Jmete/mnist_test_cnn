# mnist_test_cnn
Small test CNN on mnist

Implemented basic CNN in colab. Testing on mnist.

2 Conv layers (including batch norm and maxPool).

1 Dropout layer set at pretty standard rate of 0.4.

Initial results gave loss of 0.0667646793179214 and accuracy of 0.9787.

Note: Code includes some lines and plots for testing and visualization purposes. I hope this helps provide clarity for others that may utilize this code.
